# CNC-Machine-based-on-machine-learning
Normally CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine does the desired operation according to the G-code which is already programmed inside the system of that machine and it does that operation again and again. But this new type of approach of CNC machine through hardware machine learning doesnâ€™t need to program for every new operation. Just one time coding is enough and the machine learns automatically whatever the operation you did before manually and it stores that movement and that movements will be sequentially repeated by the machine.
